## Quick Start Guide

### Pre-Requisites

- A [modded](https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/) Nintendo Switch console running [AtmosphÃ¨re NX](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)

### Installation

[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Ixaruz/Luna-App?label=Release)](https://github.com/Ixaruz/Luna-App/releases/latest)
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/Ixaruz/Luna-App/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ixaruz/Luna-App/actions)

Head to the [release page](https://github.com/Ixaruz/Luna-App/releases/) and download the latest released luna.zip and extract it onto your Switch's SD card.   
Luna requires a save-file-template to work. either use your own save file<sup>[1]</sup> or use the included [enctemplate.zip](https://github.com/Ixaruz/Luna-App/raw/main/enctemplate.zip) and unzip it in   `SD:/config/luna/enctemplate`.

<br>
<sup>[1]</sup><smaller>under the requirement, that it has the same amount of players (or more) as the island you are trying to dump.

## Usage

When visiting an island, whether it being a dream or a friend's island, open the homebrew menu (album app) and start Luna.  
It will show you the option to dump the current island and should also display their name.

Now press the Dump button and let it work for a few seconds.
If everything went right, you now have a dumped island in the dump folder, which can be used by the game and tools like NHSE.

Thanks to:

- Slattz for being a bad bitch and creating [LibACNH](https://github.com/Slattz/LibACNH)
- WerWolv for handling my constant questioning

Luna is based on AtmosphÃ¨re's [Daybreak](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/tree/master/troposphere/daybreak), Adubbz's [NanoVG port to deko3d](https://github.com/Adubbz/nanovg-deko3d) and the filehandling of J-D-K's [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV), as well as my own arduous research on Animal Crossing: New Horizons' inner workings of visiting other people's islands.
